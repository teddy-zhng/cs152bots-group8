First, she was one of four statewide elected officials to agree to change the process for selling state bonds that ultimately resulted in paying $770,321 in commission fees to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. Second, she had no idea when she approved the new bond sale process -- called a negotiated sale -- that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive $770,321. That came months later as part of the negotiations between the bond underwriters and the Division of Bond Finance. Three quarters of a million dollars . . . The money in question is just about right. The total commission paid to Bank of America and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit was $770,321. Our colleagues at Factcheck. org, for instance, said that the contract at issue was not a no-bid contract. The state held an RFP for companies to be bond underwriters in general, not to specifically bid on bond sales. Thirty-nine companies responded, and ultimately 12 were chosen. There was no competitive bidding for the $300 million lottery revenue bond issue. The state negotiated a deal among those 12 companies. That's a no-bid contract to us, because the setup specifically prevents open competition that could produce lower interest rates. But the question here iswhether there were bids for this specific bond issue. To Bank of America . . . The fees actually were paid to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired. But what's critical to note, again, is that while Bank of America interests represented two of the 12 members of the state bond underwriting team, Sink had no idea when she approved the slate of underwriters what specific role each bank would play in any specific bond sale. And even when she approved the $300 million lottery bond issue, it wasn't yet clear whether the sale of those bonds would be by a competitive or negotiated process. The resolution she and three others approved included either option. The bond issue was using lottery revenues, not general tax revenues. That means you buying lottery tickets paid for the bond sale and the bank commissions. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit. ""That statement is accurate, as it properly notes that the negotiated bond sale process resulted in $770,000 in fees for Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, without trying to tie the money directly to Sink. Scott isn't nearly as careful in his TV ad. Sink didn't funnel $770,000 to Bank of America. First, she was one of four votes on the Cabinet to approve the particular type of bond issue in question -- along with Republicans Charlie Bronson and Bill McCollum and then-Republican Charlie Crist. Second, she had no way of knowing how much commission Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive for the bond sale when she approved the deal. Those details came months later during negotiations between state bond administrators and the banks.",not misinfo,0.0736

The math simultaneously backs up Nuttings calculations and demolishes Romneys contention. The only significant shortcoming of the graphic is that it fails to note that some of the restraint in spending was fueled by demands from congressional Republicans. The Fact Checker addressed the apparent discrepancy succinctly in a follow-up column, saying ""we did not evaluate the same thing. ""After our original fact-check published, White House spokesman Jay Carney tweeted, ""PolitiFact backs MarketWatch analysis of federal spending under POTUS & predecessors. ""Many conservative bloggers read our fact-check the same way, as they attacked us. The Facebook post does rely partly on Nuttings work, and our item addresses that, but we did not simply give our seal of approval to everything Nutting wrote. Using and slightly tweaking Nuttings methodology, we recalculated spending increases under each president back to Dwight Eisenhower and produced tables ranking the presidents from highest spenders to lowest spenders. By contrast, both the Fact Checker and the AP zeroed in on one narrower (and admittedly crucial) data point -- how to divide the responsibility between George W.  Bush and Obama for the spending that occurred in fiscal year 2009, when spending rose fastest. How you divide the spending between Bush and Obama for fiscal 2009 only makes a difference to our ruling if the shifts move Obama significantly up or down our rankings. Nutting attributed spending from the first year of every presidential term to the previous administration, arguing that every new president starts their term four months into a fiscal year begun under their predecessor. Historically, this has not been a particularly controversial approach, and even some of Nuttings critics we spoke to agreed that its not a bad rule of thumb. But fiscal year 2009 was special because it came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nations leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. Nutting did take these factors into account, but not to the extent that some critics think is needed. He also shifted excess spending beyond what Bush would have spent from the appropriations bills signed by Obama in 2009. A number of critics also argued that spending for the Troubled Asset Relief Program should be taken into account. This program aided troubled financial institutions and involved a lot of money going out the door in fiscal 2009 and a lot of money coming in the door in subsequent years as the money was paid back to the treasury. The critics note that counting the TARP expenses as Bushs artificially raises the baseline level of spending Obama inherited, thereby making Obamas subsequent spending increases seem unrealistically small. We think reasonable people can disagree on which president should be responsible for TARP spending, but to give the critics their say, well include it in our alternative calculation. So, combining the fiscal 2009 costs for programs that are either clearly or arguably Obamas -- the stimulus, the CHIP expansion, the incremental increase in appropriations over Bushs level and TARP -- produces a shift from Bush to Obama of between $307 billion and $456 billion, based on the most reasonable estimates weve seen critics offer. Thats quite a bit larger than Nuttings $140 billion, but by our calculations, it would only raise Obamas average annual spending increase from 1. 4 percent to somewhere between 3. 4 percent and 4. 9 percent. That would place Obama either second from the bottom or third from the bottom out of the 10 presidents we rated, rather than last. Our extensive consultations with budget analysts since our item was published convinces us that theres no single ""correct"" way to divvy up fiscal 2009 spending, only a variety of plausible calculations. Even using the higher of the alternative measurements, at least seven presidents had a higher average annual increases in spending.",not misinfo,0.0387
